## Features ✅
-  **3 1KOhm resistors**
-  **2 2KOhm resistors**
-  **1 3KOhm resistor**
-  **2 5KOhm resistors**
-  **2 10KOhm resistors.**

-  **10K Potentiometer**
-  **TL081 Amplifier IC**
## Why did I make it ? 🛠️
My electrical engineering teacher had some models provided by the ministry of education. But they had tiny 2mm banana terminals, and were very ugly-looking with a low quality PCB on top, mounted on a cheap electrical box.

When I showed him a project I made before, using laser-cut and engraved MDF wood, he asked me to partener up with him and make a new, better-looking, more functional model, with 4mm banana temrinals.
## CAD
Really just the top plate.

## Wiring diagram 🔌
It is pretty self explanatory on the top face with the symbols.

But here is the diagram for the amplifier IC.

The top power terminals are left unconnected. They are just there to position the power inputs directly on the model, instead of pulling a lot of wires directly from the PSU.
