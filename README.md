## Why did I make it ? 🛠️
My electrical engineering teacher had some models provided by the ministry of education. But they had tiny 2mm banana terminals, and were very ugly-looking with a low quality PCB on top, mounted on a cheap electrical box.

When I showed him a project I made before, using laser-cut and engraved MDF wood, he asked me to partener up with him and make a new, better-looking, more functional model, with 4mm banana temrinals.
