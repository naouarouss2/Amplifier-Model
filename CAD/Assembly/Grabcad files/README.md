The Grabcad files were downloaded **as SLDPRT files**.

The banana terminals were **manually copied and colored**.

The STEP files were **manually converted**. They are **not the original files on Grabcad**.

Since STEP files don't conserve the colors coming from SLDPRT or SLDASM files, the banana terminals were only conevrted to STEP once.
